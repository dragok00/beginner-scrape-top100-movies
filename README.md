# First Web Scraping Project  

The script extracts the **Top 100 Movies** from Empire Online website and saves them into a text file.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- Python  
- BeautifulSoup

## How It Works  
1. The script sends a request to Empire Online's "Best Movies" page.  
2. It scrapes the movie titles using BeautifulSoup.  
3. The movies are saved into `100-best-movies.txt`.
